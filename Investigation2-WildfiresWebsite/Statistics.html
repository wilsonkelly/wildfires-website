                    In November of 2018, the Camp Fire burnt through Northern California, 
                    becoming the deadliest and most destructive fire in the state's history. According to the
                    California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, 18,804 residential, commercial, 
                    and other structures were destroyed, and 85 people were killed.
                </br>California is at rank 1 of states with high to extreme wildfire risk in 2019, with 2,019,800 properties at risk

                <p class="right">The Insurance Information Institute estimated the Camp Fire totaled between $8.5

                AccuWeather predicts 2018 wildfires cost California alone losses of 
                $400 billion, making it the most expensive natural disaster in the history of the US. To put that into perspective, 
                that amount of money is equivalent to four tenths of a trillion dollars, and 2% of the US's GDP. The estimate 
                is made on loss of value in property, but also health impacts <a style="color: #000000;" target="_blank"
